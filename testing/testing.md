Hopfully this existing won't completely destroy the main stuff in this repo.
Have fun testing!

Refer to *20250101-Mongo_Nuxt_Get_Started.md* (in dad's repo) for more information.

Move everything relevant in the tmp folder to this one.
```bash
# Create a mongo-nuxt folder

# Change to known directory
cd ~/touchgrass
pwd
# move items
mv -v /tmp/mongo-nuxt/* ./nuxt2/testing/mongo-nuxt/
```

There are some changes you need to make to commands in the other file that you should change here.
